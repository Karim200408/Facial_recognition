# ðŸ§  Facial Movements Detection

This project implements a **real-time facial movement detection system** using Python and computer vision libraries.  
It tracks key facial features (such as eyes, mouth, eyebrows) and analyzes movements for potential applications like gesture control, emotion detection, or accessibility tools.
